# StudentUnionDAO – College Governance with DAO

## 📖 Project Description
**StudentUnionDAO** is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) created to manage college governance in a transparent and democratic manner using blockchain technology.  

The project replaces traditional student union decision-making processes with a decentralized platform where every student can participate in voting and proposals.  
It ensures transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in college administrative decisions, events, and resource allocation.
